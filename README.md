TS/OS

Current Version: Hydrogen (1.0)

TS/OS is a SysV ABI, *nix inspired (sorta), operating system with a focus on being as multiplatform as possible. 

TS/OS was a operating system made for several reasons

1: Because I got bored, and I had nothing to do

2: Because I needed to learn C/C++

3: Because I got infuriated by the fact that some devices cannot have Linux ports (like the Gameboy)

4: And finally, because I was inspired by the genius of Terry A. Davis.

TS/OS's existence is for it to be ported. With a fairly rigid and simple driver interface, it should be easy to run it on all those small devices Linux is too picky to run on. The first ports are PC, GBA and the DMG (A fancy name for the Gameboy).

I intend for TS/OS to be ported to everything. My first goal is all those handheld game consoles, PSP and below. If I can get it to run on a DMG, surely I can run it on the others.

The story behind TS/OS is a interesting one. TS/OS Hydrogen, the first edition, was mostly developed on a hacked TI-Nspire, a graphing calculator. I got bored during the winter break of my sophmore year, and I always wanted to make a OS. So I did, with the GBCPUman.pdf, a copy of The Revolutionary Guide To Assembly Language, and some random documents on the GBA.

I had just learned C++, and wanted to reinvent the wheel. I had a little too much time on my hands.

The naming of TS/OS is the floor of the TS/OS version, as the atomic number of a element. So TS/OS 1 is Hydrogen, TS/OS 2 is Helium etc (look up a periodic table).

The TS/OS kernel is called the Nucleus. Many other chemistry analagues will be made in the OS. The TS/OS version of a kernel panic is a Nucleus Fission!

In the documents directory, you can find more documents concerning TS/OS.
