# Obvious Problems

GENERAL ISSUES:

TS/OS only supports the running of one driver per catagory running at a time.

You can force the system into a graphics mode, but the OS has no support for it currently.

All the PC video drivers pretty much deal with the video mode that the PC started with, and cannot change it to a optimal mode, like other devices.
